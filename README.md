# Performance Tests

Quality scheduled performance test pipelines

## Performance Test Bed

We are working on setting up a testbed - which is an on-premise Gitlab installations - which mimics the environment of the customers. 
While the infra team is [setting up the testbed](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/60), we have spun up a VM Instance which would act as a dummy testbed in the meantime. 
This dummy testbed was setup so that the Quality team's initiatives can still continue, in terms of the integrations with Prometheus and Sitespeed. When the testbed is ready, it should be as simple as just pointing to the right instance.
